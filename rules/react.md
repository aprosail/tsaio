# React Rules

## Components

1. Use function components with hooks.
2. TypeScript for props and state.
3. Keep components small.
4. Export as default.

## Hooks

1. Use hooks at top level.
2. Create custom hooks for reusable logic.
3. Use useCallback for expensive functions.
4. Use useMemo for expensive calculations.

## Props

1. TypeScript interfaces for props.
2. Destructure props in parameters.
3. Use default values for optional props.
4. Avoid prop drilling.

## State Management

1. Use useState for local state.
2. Use useReducer for complex state.
3. Use context for global state.
4. Avoid unnecessary re-renders.

## Performance

1. Use key prop for list items.
2. Avoid inline objects and functions.
3. Use lazy loading for large components.
4. Use production builds for testing.
