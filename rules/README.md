# Rules Directory

## Purpose

This directory contains coding standards and best practices for the tsaio project. These rules guide AI code generation tools to produce elegant, consistent code.

## How It Works

1. Rules are written as markdown files.
2. Files are copied to AI tool config directories.
3. For folder-based tools: copy all files.
4. For file-based tools: concatenate content with `---` separators.

## File Organization

- Each file focuses on specific aspect
- Use clear, concise English
- Keep content brief to save tokens
- Update when adding new tools or practices

## Maintenance

- Add new rule files for new tools
- Update existing files when practices change
- Keep all files in sync
- Test rule application
